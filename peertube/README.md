**Please don't federate, there are HORRIBLE PEERTUBE SERVERS out there, really egregious and DISTURBING, so PLS don't federate, Mastodon is generally fine, but some PEERTUBE servers are ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡.

This is done on a seperate server. I don't understand why Peertube put the damn nginx and certbot into its docker container so it's really hard to use, also the docker env vars lack detailed explanation, anyways, I just installed it on another server, and yeah, everything seems working.

Peertube seems good, it uses Typescript, Whisper, Object Storage, and lots of other configs, much better than expected though, and much better than my crappy Nodejs App I finished back in 2024 March. It seems quite promising(also mentions hiring another worker).

Peertube is also used for malicious things(just like all decentralized apps), and there are malicious sites out on the open using Peertube(I won't tell it but I see many), so yeah, use tech for good.
